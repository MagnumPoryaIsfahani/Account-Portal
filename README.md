# Account-Portal
Learning full-stack web dev

Attempting to learn to be a fullstack web dev by building a simple Account-Portal.

## How to run server
After cloning run these commands
* cd api
* npm install
* npm start

## How to run client
After cloning run these commands
* cd my-app
* npm install
* npm start

### Play around
In a browser head to localhost:3000, here you can play around with my Account-Portal framework.

## TODO 
* Add in authentication using JWT
* Hash passwords using bcrypt
* Redo front end using prebuilt components for a more professional feel
* Figure out what I want to use this for...

## Notes
Currently a json file is used as a database, this is not ideal for real projects but it served as an easy starting point just to get something up and running.
There are some remenants of things I still need to clean up as I did not use them as I expected, there is potential for me to rebuild everything from the ground up with what I learned from making this.

## Retrospective
Using a json file as a database was NOT an easy starting point as I thought it would be, although it did help me practice using promises as I forced myself to use the fs.promises api
